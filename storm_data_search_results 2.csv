The storm traveled north through southwest Florida through the evening. Effects from Irma were felt across South Florida from September 9th through September 11th. Irma had reached Category 5 strength and a minimum central pressure of 914 MB east of the Bahamas, maintaining Category 5 intensity until landfall along the north coast of Cuba on September 9th. Irma made its first Florida landfall in the Lower Florida Keys early on September 10th as a Category 4 hurricane. ||The strength and size of Hurricane Irma allowed for impacts to be felt across all of South Florida. Irma brought widespread wind damage, heavy rainfall and storm surge to all areas. Hurricane-force sustained wind were measured in much of Collier County, as well as far southern and inland Miami-Dade County, with the possibility of additional hurricane-force sustained wind in more isolated areas over the remainder of South Florida where widespread tropical storm force sustained wind occurred. Gusts to hurricane force were felt over all of South Florida, with the maximum measured wind gust of 142 mph in Naples in Collier County. Widespread tree damage and some structural damage occurred across all of South Florida, with most structural damage on the minor side.||Irma brought a significant storm surge on both coasts of South Florida. Storm surge of 6 to 8 feet was observed in the Everglades City and Goodland areas of Collier County, with 3 to 5 feet from Marco Island to Naples. Along the east coast, observed storm surge values of 4 to 6 feet were noted along Biscayne Bay from south of Miami to Homestead, and 2 to 4 feet elsewhere along the east coast from Key Biscayne to Palm Beach.||Hurricane Irma brought widespread rainfall and some flooding across the region. From the period between 8 AM EDT September 9th and 8 AM EDT September 11th, 8 to 15 inches of rain were measured over interior portions of Southwest Florida, with estimated amounts of 16 to 20 inches in southwestern Hendry County. This rainfall near the end of a wet summer led to significant flooding over these areas. 5 to 10 inches of rain were noted elsewhere across South Florida, with areas of minor to moderate flooding. ||32 deaths were attributed to Irma in southern Florida, all but one indirect. The only direct death was an 86-year-old man who was knocked down by a gust of wind while opening the front door of his home in Broward County. Most of the deaths occurred during cleanup after the storm, as well as several as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning from misuse of generators. Initial and incomplete damage estimate across the area is estimated to be around $800 million, but in all likelihood will be much higher once damage assessments are completed. $222.5 million in damage came in from Collier County, and about $300 million from Palm Beach County. About $255 million came from the agricultural community in Miami-Dade County.||Total number of people who were at county evacuation shelters were as follows: Miami-Dade County - 31,092, Palm Beach County - 17,263, Collier County - 17,040, Broward County - 17,000, Hendry County - 3,000||Total number of customers without power were as follows: Miami-Dade County - 888,530, Broward County - 689,000, Palm Beach County- 566,240, Collier County -  197,630, Hendry County - 9,700, Glades County - 1,670.",58

Later rainfall estimates from CoCoRAHS observers reported approximately 7 to 10 inches of rainfall by the following morning.","Strong low pressure over the eastern Gulf of Mexico resulted in a slow-moving pre-frontal trough focusing heavy convective rainfall over portions of the middle and upper Florida Keys.  One EF0 tornado was observed on Big Pine Key in association with a small supercell which evolved in advance of the passing squall line. In additional, strong winds associated with a convectively-induced mesoscale low pressure system over the middle and upper Florida Keys resulted in moderate to major coastal flooding near the shores of Barnes and Card Sounds.",72

Four trailer pads closest to the shoreline had the           concession resident trailers damaged, including one RV with heavy damage. Time is estimated based on report time and high tide.","Enhanced pressure gradients between a surface high and stalled frontal boundary produced strong and gusty northeasterly winds across much of South Florida beginning on December 13th, with winds eventually turning southerly and peaking on December 16th and 17th when gale force winds occurred over the local waters. Bands of showers moved across the region on the 16th and early on the 17th, producing wind gusts up to 50-60 mph over the waters. Due to the prolonged period of gusty gradient winds and convective gusts, it led to a spike in high tides, which created coastal flooding in Palm Beach (Dec 16) and Flamingo (Dec 17) during the local high tides.",74
