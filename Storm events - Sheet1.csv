The slow-moving storm, which tracked south of New England, dumped over two feet of snow across the interior, knocked out power to about 80,000 customers, and shut down businesses and schools for several days. There were also many reports of downed trees and wires during the height of the storm, along with reports of lightning and thunder. Hundreds of flights at Logan International Airport were canceled, as were flights at other nearby airports. In magnitude, it was the worst storm to affect the state since 1992, and a state of emergency was in effect for three days. After the storm, the weight of the heavy wet snow caused several roof collapses throughout the state, most notably at a church in Westford. No injuries were reported. Damage from this storm was estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars.
 
 
 
 The highest snowfall totals were reported from the east slopes of the Berkshires across Worcester County and into northeast Massachusetts, where amounts of 15 to 30 inches were common. Greater Boston received between 12 and 22 inches of snow, but Logan International Airport received 9.8 inches from this storm. Amounts in southeast Massachusetts ranged from 2 to 4 inches along the immediate coast to as much as a foot farther inland. Other official totals include 23 inches at the Blue Hills Observatory in Milton, 22 inches at Worcester Airport, and 9.5 inches at the National Weather Service in Taunton.
 
 
 
 Powerful northeast winds affected much of east coastal and southeast Massachusetts. Speeds of 50 to 60 mph were widely observed and caused damage to trees and power lines, especially on Cape Cod and the islands. Some unofficial gusts reported by spotters include 64 mph in Wareham, 61 mph in Fairhaven, and 60 mph at Nauset Beach in Orleans. At Chatham Municipal Airport, winds gusted to 63 mph.
 
 
 
 High tides during the storm ran 2 to 3 feet above normal, resulting in widespread coastal flooding along the entire east facing coastline, including Cape Cod and the islands. The strong surf slammed sea walls and flooded beachfront homes and roadways, and damaged a part of the sea wall in Winthrop. In Marblehead, Ocean Avenue and Front Street were flooded, as was Nahant Road in Nahant. In Winthrop, Winthrop Shore Drive, Shirley Avenue, and Moore and Charles Streets were flooded. Flood waters also impacted the Jamaicaway in Boston and Quincy Shore Drive in Quincy. In Hull, flooding affected Gun Rock, Atlantic, and Nantasket Avenues while in Scituate, flooding affected Turner and Jericho Roads as well as 5th, 6th, and 7th Avenues. In its wake, the flooding left behind piles of seaweed, pieces of deck and lawn furniture, and even lobsters and fish.",2

Major flooding of a number of small streams and main stem rivers occurred in Essex County of Massachusetts. The Governor of Massachusetts declared a State of Emergency for a time during this event, and the President declared major disaster status for those affected in Essex, Middlesex, and Suffolk Counties in Massachusetts. At some locations, this was the worst flooding recorded since the 1938 Hurricane and the great rain/snowmelt floods in March 1936.
 
 
 
 The focus of heavy rain shifted to eastern Massachusetts late Friday night through Monday morning with Essex and eastern Middlesex Counties impacted the greatest. Storm rainfall totaled 8 to 12 inches across the area with a few locations in Essex County even exceeding 12 inches.
 
 
 
 The event prompted the evacuation of several thousand people in northeast Massachusetts and numerous road closures, including U.S. Route 1, a major artery for Boston-bound commuters. A number of schools were closed for several days due to the flooding. 
 
 
 
 About a half dozen dams, including ones along the Spicket River in Methuen, Mystic River in Arlington, and the Pow Wow River in Amesbury, raised the concerns of local officials and were monitored closely. Concerns with these dams did trigger precautionary evacuations. A small dam did fail in Rowley with limited impact (partial road washouts). 
 
 
 
 At least two communities have had issues with sewage running directly off into near by rivers due to washed out culverts and roads. A major sewage release into the Merrimack River impacted shellfish beds along the northeast Massachusetts coast.
 
 
 
 Record flows were recorded along some streams, including the Spicket, Ipswich and Parker Rivers in Essex County Massachusetts. Other crests were the highest since the 1938 Hurricane or 1936 floods. 
 
 
 
 For those main stem rivers in northeast Massachusetts with long periods of record, this event featured the highest crests since the 1938 Hurricane and 1936 heavy rain/snowmelt floods. The Merrimack River at Haverhill reached the third highest crest on record. The Merrimack River at Lowell reached its fourth highest crest on record (a record long enough to include a historical April event in 1852). As an interesting footnote to this event, this episode now stands as the most significant flood event on the main stem Merrimack River since the advent of Flood Control in the basin.
 
 
 
 Two fatalities (adult males) were attributed to flooding from the storm. Both occurred in Topsfield in the vicinity of the Ipswich River. Both fatalities appeared to be weather-related. One of the fatalities was reported to have occurred after a person drove around barricades in the road, and one occurred after a person was swept into the river.",4

A few higher higher gusts occurred along the Rhode Island coast. A severe thunderstorm embedded in an outer band associated with Sandy produced wind gusts to 90 mph and concentrated damage in Wareham early Tuesday evening, |a day after the center of Sandy had moved into New Jersey. In general, moderate coastal flooding occurred along the Massachusetts coastline, and major coastal flooding impacted the Rhode Island coastline. The storm surge was generally 2.5 to 4.5 feet along the east coast of Massachusetts, but peaked late Monday afternoon in between high tide cycles. Seas built to between 20 and 25 feet Monday afternoon and evening just off the Massachusetts east coast. Along the south coast, the storm surge was 4 to 6 feet and seas from 30 to a little over 35 feet were observed in the outer coastal waters. The very large waves on top of the storm surge caused destructive coastal flooding along stretches of the Rhode Island exposed south coast. ||Sandy grew into a hurricane over the southwest Caribbean and then headed north across Jamaica, Cuba, and the Bahamas. As Sandy headed north of the Bahamas, the storm interacted with a vigorous weather system moving west to east across the United States and began to take on a hybrid structure. Strong high pressure over southeast Canada helped with the expansion of the strong winds well north of the center of Sandy. In essence, Sandy retained the structure of a hurricane near its center (until shortly before landfall) while taking on more of an extra-tropical cyclone configuration well away from the center. SandyÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩs track was unusual.

What made this an amazing storm was the widespread coverage of heavy snowfall. Most locations received 2 to 2.5 feet of snow! A stationary band of even heavier snowfall persisted from southwest NH through central MA and on to the southwest across central and western CT. In those areas, reports averaged closer to 2.5 to 3 feet! Along the southeast MA coast, average amounts ranged from 1 to 2 feet. Only on MarthaÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩs Vineyard and Nantucket were snowfall totals less than 1 foot (6 to 12 inches). Isolated thunderstorms were common across the entire region during the height of the storm.||A low pressure system advancing from the Great Lakes region combined forces with a very moist low pressure system moving northeast from the Gulf Coast states. Explosive deepening took place Friday evening, February 8, as a low center moved from the North Carolina coast to south of Nantucket. Strong high pressure to the north of New England helped ensure that cold air remained in place over the area. Snowfall gained intensity during the afternoon, but during the night, 2 to 3 inch per hour amounts were common throughout the region. The band of heaviest snowfall, with 3 to 5 inches per hour for several hours, extended from southwest NH to central and western CT. The precipitation started as mainly snow, although a brief period of rain at the onset was common on the Islands. Snow ended in the morning in western and central MA, southwest NH, most of CT and RI, and in the early afternoon across eastern MA. It lingered during the whole afternoon over Cape Cod and Nantucket, aided by some ocean-effect bands of snowfall.||The Blizzard of 2013 also produced a prolonged period of very strong winds Friday night along the MA and RI coasts. Gusts exceeded hurricane force (74 mph) at a few locations. Gale force gusts (to 50 mph) continued on the MA coast through Saturday afternoon. The strong winds, combined with a wet snow, led to extensive power outages from downed trees and wires in southeast coastal MA and in southern RI. Elsewhere, farther inland, the snow became drier and did not cling to trees like it did along the south and southeast coast of New England. Some wind gusts included: 76 mph at Logan IntÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩl. Airport (Boston, MA), 75 mph at Bedford, MA, 77 mph at Hyannis, MA and 68 mph in Jamestown, RI. Damaging gusts to 60 mph were recorded as far west as Worcester County, MA. Wind gusts of 35 to 50 mph were common elsewhere in southern New England.| |In addition, moderate to major coastal flooding occurred, most notably during the time of the high tide Saturday morning along the Massachusetts east coast. At the storm's height near the early morning low tide, the storm surge reached 3 to 4 feet along much of the MA east coast from Boston south. At the time of the mid-morning high tide, the winds had shifted from northeast to north and the surge had dropped to 1.5 to 2.5 feet for most MA east coast locations. However, this was an astronomically high tide given the nearness to the time of the new moon, and waves to 30 feet had built just 15 miles off the coast. Consequently, many coastal roadways were impassable from Salisbury and Gloucester to Marshfield and Scituate on the south shore and on parts of Cape Cod. Water several feet deep was seen flowing into some vulnerable homes in Scituate. Although there was some structural damage, it did not come close to what was experienced during the Blizzard of 1978.

Some of the highest totals reported include Hudson, MA (36 inches), Acton, MA (34 inches), Thompson, CT (33.5 inches), and Methuen, MA (31.5 inches). Much of southeast Massachusetts and the rest of Rhode Island received one to two feet of snow. Totals dropped off dramatically west of the Connecticut River Valley where totals of 4 to 8 inches were observed. ||The storm was well-forecast, with Blizzard Watches and Winter Storm Watches issued 2 days before the snow began. Low pressure tracked northeast from the Carolinas and strengthened rapidly as it slowly passed southeast of Nantucket on Monday evening, January 26. All of the precipitation fell as snow with this storm. At its peak, snowfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour were common. In Massachusetts, blizzard conditions were officially reported in Marshfield (14 hours), Hyannis (13 hours), Nantucket (11 hours), Boston (9 hours), Chatham (9 hours), Worcester (7 hours), and Beverly (3 hours). In Rhode Island, blizzard conditions were officially reported in Westerly (5 hours), Newport (4 hours), and at T.F. Green State Airport in Warwick (3 hours). Several other locations fell just short of the required criteria (3 consecutive hours of blizzard conditions) including Fitchburg, New Bedford, Falmouth, and MarthaÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩs Vineyard in Massachusetts and Smithfield in Rhode Island.||Daily snowfall records were set for January 27 in Boston (22.1 inches, previous record 8.8 inches in 2011), Worcester (31.9 inches, previous record 11.0 in 2011), and Providence (16.0 inches, previous record 6.7 inches in 2011). In Worcester, the snowfall total of 34.5 inches was the greatest on record (dating back to 1892), breaking the previous record of 33.0 inches on March 31 to April 1, 1997. In Providence, the total of 19.1 inches was the fourth highest on record (dating back to 1904), while in Boston the total of 24.6 inches was the sixth highest on record (dating back to 1872).||The Blizzard of January 2015 produced very strong winds late Monday into Tuesday near the Massachusetts and Rhode Island coasts where gusts of 50 to 65 mph were common. Gusts reached hurricane force at a few locations in Massachusetts including Nantucket (78 mph), Chatham (75 mph), Humarock (74 mph), and Aquinnah (74 mph).||Significant coastal flooding occurred along the Massachusetts east coast, mainly south of Boston. Due to a north-northeast wind around the time of the early morning high tide, BostonÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩs north shore was spared to some degree with mostly minor impacts. North and east facing coastlines from Hull to Chatham as well as Nantucket experienced moderate to major coastal flooding with some areas experiencing inundation in excess of 3 feet and pockets of structural damage, especially where sea walls and other protective devices were compromised. Severe erosion was reported along portions of the coastline south of Boston. The Sandwich area was especially hard hit with erosion as a consequence of strong onshore winds by the time of the early morning high tide. Very preliminary estimates indicate that the coastal impact along the eastern Massachusetts coast south of Boston was generally comparable to but in a few locations a little greater than the February 2013 Blizzard. Residents had to be evacuated from neighborhoods in Hull and Scituate.||The governor of Massachusetts declared a travel ban that began on January 27th at midnight and was lifted county-by-county as conditions allowed. Power outages were few (limited mainly to Cape Cod and the Islands) but had a high impact as all power was out on the island of Nantucket. Logan International Airport was closed through 6 am January 28th. A total of 116 cities and towns declared local states of emergency during this storm, activating their Emergency Operations Centers. Most Amtrak, ferry, train, and bus service was suspended for January 27th, prior to the storm. Over 40 shelters opened, serving a total of 450 individuals.||Two fatalities were reported as a result of this storm: a 97 year old man who died while trying to clear a carbon dioxide vent at his home in Yarmouth and a 53 year old man in New Bedford who died while snow blowing his neighbors driveway.||President Obama issued a federal disaster declaration for the eastern parts of Massachusetts for this storm, allowing federal assistance for emergency work and repairs to facilities damaged by the storm.",30

Although it was not deep low pressure and although it passed just south of the 40N/70W benchmark, its precipitation shield was expansive because of a broad 700 mb low over southeast New England, abundant moisture, and a very cold air mass in place. By far, the heaviest snow fell to the north (Laconia, NH) and west (Binghamton, NY), where more than 3 feet fell. But amounts ranged from 10 to 20 inches across much of southern New England. There was some minor coastal flooding at the time of high tide and also a flash freeze in eastern Massachusetts as the storm pulled away to the northeast.",69
